                In my 10 years of production experience I've found that a solid design phase is vital to a beautiful project.
                This is why I plan out most or all of an application, before I touch a single line of code.
                <br/><br/>
                The design process is fluid however, and I often test and modify designs as the project is developed and opportunities to change function or form arise.

                Working on the front end is my favorite part of software development.
                <br/><br/>
                I love to grow and shape an application from its barebones version all the way into a fully fleshed piece, seeing the progress each time I hit save.
                I spend the most of my time in the front end development phase, and usually work with mock data to save worrying about the underlying pipework for later.

                Back end code is where form meets the function.
                <br/><br/>
                I like to think of server code as a series of pipes pumping data to the user through the client layer.
                Once I have figured out all of the data I will need and where it will go, I get to work on the real engine behind the magic.
